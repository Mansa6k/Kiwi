# Crypto Clustering
Overview

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to cluster a dataset of cryptocurrency price change data. The goal is to identify groups of cryptocurrencies that have similar price movements over time. The project involves using K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster the data and visualize the results using the hvPlot and Matplotlib libraries.
